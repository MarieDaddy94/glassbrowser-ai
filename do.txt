# GlassBrowser Panel Refactor Checklist

Purpose: convert panel dependency review into implementation-ready checks.
Format: Owner module -> required contract -> test that proves wiring.

## Global Contracts (must hold before panel-level work)

- [x] `App.tsx` only orchestrates mode routing and shared providers.
  - Contract: domain polling/execution logic lives in controllers/services, not inline.
  - Proof test: `rg -n "setInterval\\(|setTimeout\\(" App.tsx` shows no domain polling loops.

- [x] `services/brokerRequestBridge.ts` is the only generic broker-request entry.
  - Contract: runtime callers do not call `window.glass.broker.request` directly.
  - Proof test: `rg -n "broker\\.request\\(" hooks components services | rg -v "App.tsx|tests"` returns no bypass callsites.

- [x] `services/runtimeScheduler.ts` owns recurring tasks.
  - Contract: controller/hook recurring jobs are registered tasks with stats.
  - Proof test: monitor telemetry shows registered tasks with run/error counters.

- [x] `services/workerTaskRouter.ts` routes heavy compute with fallback.
  - Contract: setup watcher, frame-gap analysis, replay aggregation run through worker clients.
  - Proof test: worker-client tests validate success/timeout/cancel/fallback.

- [x] `services/cacheBudgetManager.ts` budgets all long-lived caches/queues.
  - Contract: each major cache has max + eviction telemetry.
  - Proof test: telemetry panel shows cache sizes/evictions/hit-rate.

## Panel-by-Panel Refactor Contract Checklist

### 1) Chat
- [x] Owner: `components/ChatInterface.tsx`, `hooks/useChat.ts`, `services/chat*`.
- [x] Contract: chat workflow/tool routing is lazy-loaded by path; no startup-heavy prompt builders in initial parse path.
- [x] Proof test: send message + tool call + voice path all pass; no startup regressions.

### 2) Chart Chat
- [x] Owner: `components/ChatInterface.tsx` (`channel="chart"`), `hooks/useChartSessions.ts`.
- [x] Contract: chart-channel uses same action bus and broker bridge as chat channel.
- [x] Proof test: chart chat action opens chart context and executes tool flow without duplicate broker pulls.

### 3) Signal
- [x] Owner: `components/SignalInterface.tsx`, `controllers/signalController.ts`.
- [x] Contract: scans use scheduler + broker coordinator, not direct polling.
- [x] Proof test: scan cadence visible in scheduler stats; broker dedupe hits rise during repeated scans.

### 4) Snapshot
- [x] Owner: `components/SnapshotInterface.tsx`, `services/warmupPlanner.ts`, `services/historySharedCache.ts`.
- [x] Contract: warmup is adaptive, reuses shared history cache.
- [x] Proof test: repeated snapshot refresh on same symbol/timeframe reduces broker fetch count.

### 5) Calendar
- [x] Owner: `components/CalendarInterface.tsx`, `controllers/calendarController.ts`.
- [x] Contract: sync runs via scheduler visibility-aware task.
- [x] Proof test: background tab slows calendar sync cadence automatically.

### 6) Patterns
- [x] Owner: `components/PatternsInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: detector refresh paths use broker bridge/coordinator.
- [x] Proof test: rapid filter changes do not produce request storms.

### 7) Shadow
- [x] Owner: `components/ShadowInterface.tsx`, `controllers/shadowController.ts`.
- [x] Contract: live-deploy checks run through execution controller paths, not ad-hoc loops.
- [x] Proof test: toggle live deploy and observe stable scheduler/controller health.

### 8) Auto (inside Shadow)
- [x] Owner: `components/AutoPilotInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: automation actions consume shared memory/task-tree and execution buses.
- [x] Proof test: auto workflow run updates shadow metrics and emits audit trail entries.

### 9) Notes
- [x] Owner: `components/NotesInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: notes actions route through action catalog runtime, no direct side-channel broker calls.
- [x] Proof test: note capture + replay action succeeds and logs to audit.

### 10) Rank
- [x] Owner: `components/LeaderboardInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: rank reads academy/scorecard outputs from persisted state, no hidden polling loop.
- [x] Proof test: restart app and verify ranking stability with persisted outcomes.

### 11) Academy
- [x] Owner: `components/AcademyInterface.tsx`, `controllers/academyController.ts`.
- [x] Contract: outcome updates and lesson filters use persisted memory/ledger paths.
- [x] Proof test: create/resolve signal outcome, restart, verify lesson and score persistence.

### 12) Dash
- [x] Owner: `components/PerformanceDashboard.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: dashboard reads research registry results without recomputing heavy reductions on main thread.
- [x] Proof test: open dashboard after long backtest run with no UI freeze.

### 13) Monitor
- [x] Owner: `components/MonitorInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: monitor surfaces scheduler, cache, broker, startup health from shared telemetry snapshot.
- [x] Proof test: monitor view shows task stats, cache budgets, and bridge/readiness fields.

### 14) MT5
- [x] Owner: `components/MT5Interface.tsx`, `hooks/useMt5Bridge.ts`.
- [x] Contract: generic broker requests use coordinator path; account-local bridge ops remain local.
- [x] Proof test: MT5 symbol/quote operations do not bypass request bridge.

### 15) Locker (TradeLocker)
- [x] Owner: `components/TradeLockerInterface.tsx`, `hooks/useTradeLocker.ts`.
- [x] Contract: startup auto-restore runs once per boot after bridge ready; no loop.
- [x] Proof test: cold boot with saved profile attempts one restore and reports deterministic outcome.

### 16) Chart (Native)
- [x] Owner: `components/NativeChartInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: fallback/health probes use broker bridge with dedupe context tags.
- [x] Proof test: rapid chart timeframe toggles collapse duplicate history requests.

### 17) Backtest
- [x] Owner: `components/BacktesterInterface.tsx`, `components/backtester/*`.
- [x] Contract: heavy replay/stat reductions use replay worker client with fallback.
- [x] Proof test: replay + optimize under load remains responsive; worker/fallback tests pass.

### 18) Setups
- [x] Owner: `components/SetupsInterface.tsx`, `services/setupWatcherWorkerClient.ts`.
- [x] Contract: watcher evaluations run through worker router with timeout/cancel/fallback.
- [x] Proof test: large watcher set evaluates without main-thread stalls.

### 19) Memory
- [x] Owner: `components/AgentMemoryInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: memory queries use persisted store + capped caches.
- [x] Proof test: long-run memory browsing does not increase cache beyond budget.

### 20) Lab
- [x] Owner: `components/AgentLabInterface.tsx`, `components/AgentTestHarnessPanel.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: lab actions route through same action/runtime interfaces as production paths.
- [x] Proof test: harness workflow emits identical action result shape as live mode.

### 21) Audit
- [x] Owner: `components/AuditTrailInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: reads from consolidated audit source and supports replay hooks.
- [x] Proof test: replay from audit entry restores expected task-tree path.

### 22) Changes
- [x] Owner: `components/ChangesInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Contract: consumes reduced/aggregated audit deltas, not raw spam stream.
- [x] Proof test: repeated warning bursts appear as aggregated counters.

## Shared Bus Verification Checklist

- [x] Action Catalog Bus
  - Contract: all panel command actions use catalog runtimes.
  - Proof test: representative actions across chat/notes/setups/audit/changes all resolve through runtime handlers.

- [x] Broker Coordinator
  - Contract: dedupe key `(method,symbol,timeframe,maxAge,argsHash)` is enforced across signal/snapshot/chart/backtest/settings.
  - Proof test: mixed-panel session shows in-flight dedupe hits and reduced broker warn volume.

- [x] Worker Router
  - Contract: setup watcher, signal analysis, replay aggregation go through router clients.
  - Proof test: unit tests for success/timeout/cancel/fallback; runtime telemetry indicates worker usage.

- [x] Diagnostics Aggregation
  - Contract: warning floods collapse into classed aggregation windows; critical/errors unsuppressed.
  - Proof test: live log shows `aggregatedCount/windowMs/suppressedCount` for repeated warnings.

- [x] Cache Budgeting
  - Contract: research cache, history cache, task queues, tech log cache all bounded and reported.
  - Proof test: 30-60 minute soak run shows stable memory trend and active evictions.

## Completion Gate (all required)

- [x] `npm run build`
- [x] `npm test -- --runInBand`
- [x] `npm run bundle:budget`
- [x] `npm run release:validate`
- [x] `npm run electron:dist`
- [x] `node scripts/releasePackSmoke.cjs`

## Manual Soak Validation

- [ ] Run Signal + Snapshot + Backtest concurrently for 10-15 min.
- [ ] Verify Shadow/Auto execution behavior unchanged.
- [ ] Verify TradeLocker/MT5 remain connected and usable.
- [ ] Verify Telemetry panel reports scheduler, broker dedupe, worker usage, cache stats.
